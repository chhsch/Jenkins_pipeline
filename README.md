## Pipelines
We have two pipelines:
- **Main Pipeline**: Runs when changes are merged into `main`.
- **Feature1 Pipeline**: Runs on feature branches except `main`.

## About `main`
This pipeline will run for all branches except `main`.  
We are developing a release pipeline that triggers when we commit or push to `main`.  
Once changes are merged into `main`, this pipeline will execute.  
For other pipelines, ensure they are configured not to run on the `main` branch.

- Add the **Pipeline** and **Multibranch Pipeline** plugins.

### 2. Create a Multibranch Pipeline Job

### 3. Configure SCM (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Under **Branch Sources**, select **Git** or **GitHub**.

### 4. Define the `Jenkinsfile`
- Ensure your repository has a `Jenkinsfile` defining the pipeline stages.

### 5. Set Up Branch Filtering
